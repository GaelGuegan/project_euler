## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems  
that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics  
will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and  
programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a  
platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new  
concepts in a fun and recreational context.

Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.  
It includes over 670 problems, with a new one added once every one or two weeks.  
Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.  
As of June 2019 Project Euler has more than 900,000 users, from all over the world, who have solved at least one problem.

## Who are the problems aimed at?

The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding  
their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had  
an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem  
solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.  

## Can anyone solve the problems?

The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning.  
That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to  
undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So the determined participant will slowly  
but surely work his/her way through every problem.
